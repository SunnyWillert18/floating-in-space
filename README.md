Repository hosting the data I collected during my time travelling, as well as any analyses done. Basically just a work space to nerd out on my backpacking data.

As an Italian Anarchist once told me "I can't think of anything I would enjoy less doing, but you seem to be super passionate about it, so hell yea go for it"
